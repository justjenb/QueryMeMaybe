## Description

Creating a command-line application that accepts user input allows me to understand how to handle and process user commands effectively. Additionally, I will learn how to interact with databases, retrieve and format data, and perform data manipulation tasks. This project enables me to explore various functionalities such as creating tables, inserting data, and updating records. Ultimately, building this application will enhance my overall understanding of the development process and equip me with valuable experience for future projects.
